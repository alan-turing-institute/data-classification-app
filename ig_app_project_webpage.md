## Page content

### 1 sentence summary/sub-heading
(1 sentence, present tense, e.g. Using…, Developing…, Investigating…) 

Delivering an open source "information governance system in a box" to support data protection in trustworthy research environments.

### Brief description
(Clear, concise, ~3 sentences – e.g. 1st sentence: the problem being addressed, 2nd sentence: the potential solution/method, 3rd sentence: applications, output) *

How can researchers be confident that a trustworthy research environment is configured with the right level of protections for the data analysed within it, in line with data protection standards?   

### Aims/expected outcomes
(What is the work hoping to achieve? What would define success? Why is this work worth doing?)
100-300 words *



### Explaining the science
(Is there theory or methods that would be good to explain to understand the project’s work better? Use plain English where possible)
100-300 words *


### Real world applications
(Where is this work being applied, what area/industry could it benefit?)
100-300 words *
