### 1 sentence summary/sub-heading

(1 sentence, present tense, e.g. Using…, Developing…, Investigating…)

Delivering an open source "information governance system in a box" to support data protection in trustworthy research environments.

### Brief description

(Clear, concise, ~3 sentences – e.g. 1st sentence: the problem being addressed, 2nd sentence: the potential solution/method, 3rd sentence: applications, output) *

How can researchers be confident that a trustworthy research environment is configured with the right level of protections for the data analysed within it, in line with data protection standards?
Developed alongside the Turing's Data Safe Haven, the purpose of the Turing’s information governance app is to bring people from diverse backgrounds - investigators, data protection experts, and other researchers - to assess datasets and arrive at a sensitivity classification for the data and the technical recommendations for the protections needed. 
This project is looking to make the app implementable at other institutions and organisations as an open source tool. 

### Aims/expected outcomes

(What is the work hoping to achieve? What would define success? Why is this work worth doing?)
100-300 words *

This project is building towards an open-source version of the Turing Information Governance app that can be deployed by other research organisations to support their data management and trusted research environment infrastructure. 
We're preparing this release through a combination of technical work, user testing, and a deep understanding of the existing information governance processes and needs at different institutions.
It also aims to provide a record of decision-making around information governance and data protection to comply with audit requirements. 
In the first phase, funded by Turing 2.0, the project team are seeking to set up the potential deployment of the app across the Turing, UCL, and Cambridge. 

### Explaining the science

(Is there theory or methods that would be good to explain to understand the project’s work better? Use plain English where possible)
100-300 words *

[XXXX need someone to talk about how the app is made!] 

### Real world applications

(Where is this work being applied, what area/industry could it benefit?)
100-300 words *

There are growing numbers of trusted research environments being deployed across academia and other research intensive fields to offer increased data security and comply with data protection legislation. 
However, deciding what level of protection a particular dataset needs is not always straightforward, since it depends on the type of data, how it has been processed, and how it will be used in the analysis. 
Typically, assessing these aspects of datasets requires a form or meeting, which can often feel unconnected to the rest of the research process. 
The process can also vary between departments and institutions, making it difficult to come to a consensus on how trusted research environments should be configured for interdisciplinary projects.
