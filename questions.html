Expert review is needed to determine the degree to which such datasets could allow individuals to be identified.</li></ul><p>It is important that both researchers and Dataset Providers consider the level of confidence they have in the likelihood of identifying individuals from data. Anonymised data is data which under no circumstances can be used to identify an individual, and this is less common than many realise (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10933-3">Rocher et al., 2019</a>).</p><p>Our model specifies three levels of confidence that classifiers can have about the likelihood of reidentification, with each pointing to a different tier - absolute confidence, where no doubt is involved, strong confidence, or weak confidence. Classifiers should give sufficient thought to this question to ensure they are classifying data to the appropriate sensitivity.</p><h3 id='living_individual'>living_individual</h3><h5>Guidance</h5><p>A <strong>living individual</strong> is an individual for whom you do not have reasonable evidence that they are deceased. If youâ€™re unsure if the data subject is alive or dead, assume they have a lifespan of 100 years and act accordingly. If youâ€™re unsure of their age, assume 16 for any adult and 0 for any child, unless you have contextual evidence that allows you to make a reasonable assumption otherwise (<a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/guide-to-archiving-personal-data.pdf">National Archives, 2018</a>).</p><h3 id='markdown_example'>markdown_example</h3><h5>Guidance</h5><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
