        Will the research generate (including by selecting, or sorting 
        or combining) any [personal data](#personal_data)?
    guidance: |
        Generating personal data means creating any **new** personal data, 
        regardless of what data you're starting with. For example:
        
        * Linking diseases to particular patients
        * Spotting trends in tweets mentioning a particular individual

    text: |
        Will any project input be [personal data](#personal_data)?
    guidance: |
        Will you be using any personal data at all throughout the research, 
        even if it's publicly available? For example:
        
        * Personal data such as newspaper articles on celebrities, 
        or details of patients in a medical trial
        * Facebook or twitter posts
    yes: public_and_open

    text: |
        Is that [personal data](#personal_data) legally accessible 
        by the general public with no restrictions on use?
    guidance: |
        Data is legally accessible if it is **not** behind a 
        paywall, can be accessed without having to request it, and has 
        **no** conditions on its use. For example:
        
        * Voter registration records are **not** available, as they have 
        restrictions on access and use
        * Academic articles that are not open source require subscription 
        to a journal, or a request for access from the author, are **not** 
        legally accessible

    text: |
        Is that [personal data](#personal_data) [pseudonymized](#pseudonymized_data)?
    guidance: |
        Have steps been taken so that information can no longer be directly 
        linked to a particular individual, without additional information? 
        For example:
        
        * Replacing names of patients with patient ID numbers
        * Customer records with all name and address details removed
    yes: no_reidentify_absolute
    no: substantial_threat
  - name: no_reidentify_absolute
    format: markdown
    text: |
        Do you have absolute confidence that it is not possible to identify 
        individuals from the data, either at the point of entry or as a 
        result of any analysis that may be carried out?
    guidance: |
        Any data pseudonymised to this degree cannot be connected back to 
        individuals through analysis, even in combination with other datasets. 
        For example:
        
        * Research results with generated fake names, where the 
        pseudonymisation key is deleted, never to be used again
        * Anonymous responses to a public survey without any identifying 
        information

        Will you be working with [commercial-in-confidence information
        ](#commercial_data) or private third-party intellectual property, or 
        legally or politically sensitive data?
    guidance: |
        This is any information that the data provider would not be 
        comfortable with you publishing, including purchased or requested data. 
        For example:
        
        * Pay to view news articles are private third-party intellectual 
        property
        * Plans for marketing campaigns, or purchasing strategies, for 
        companies, are commercial in-confidence data

    text: |
        Will releasing any of the datasets or results impact on the competitive 
        advantage of the research team?
    guidance: |
        This includes data that may be planned for publication in the future, 
        or could be published without any issue, but is not yet publicly 
        available. For example:
        
        * Results from a study, that a research team hopes to submit to 
        Nature.
        * Visualisations of existing publicly available data
    yes: tier_1
    no: tier_0
  - name: substantial_threat
    format: markdown
    text: |
        Would disclosure pose a substantial threat to the personal safety, 
        health or security of the data subjects?
    guidance: |
        Could this data be used to blackmail, target or persecute individuals? 
        Is it likely that motivated teams might try to access this data 
        illegally? For example:
        
        * Linking location data to members of a controversial group
        * Information on the sexuality of individuals in a region where this 
        may lead to arrest or abuse
    yes: tier_4
    no: tier_3

    format: markdown
    text: |
        Do you have high confidence that the commercial, legal, reputational or 
        political consequences of unauthorised disclosure of this data will be 
        low?
    guidance: |
        Is there **no risk** that the reputation of the 
        researcher or data provider will be damaged by this data being made 
        public, or that legal action can be taken as a result? For example:
        
        * Financial reports that an organisation sells to businesses for 
        commercial profit
        * Anonymised non-controversial user research

    text: |
        Do you have high confidence that the commercial, legal, reputational or 
        political consequences of unauthorised disclosure of this data will be 
        so low as to be trivial?
    guidance: |
        Would the data providers be prepared to release their data 
        (accidentally or deliberately)? For example:
        
        * Results that a data provider has indicated they are happy to go 
        into a research publication
        * Fully anonymised data on trends not linked to a company or 
        commercial interests
    yes: tier_1
    no: tier_2
  - name: no_reidentify_strong

    text: |
        Do you have strong confidence that it is not possible to identify 
        individuals from the data, either at the point of entry or as a 
        result of any analysis that may be carried out?
    guidance: |
        Any data pseudonymised to this degree cannot be connected with 
        individuals, unless combined with data not publicly available, **or** 
        the effort required to de-pseudonymise would be too high to 
        be feasible for a person acting on their own. For example:
        
        * Medical test results with generated fake names, where only the 
        pseudonymisation key be used to identify the patients in this one 
        study
        * Anonymous responses to a public survey, where questions may lead 
        to identifying information in combination with purchasable IP address 
        data

        intellectual property, or trade secrets.
  - name: personal_data
    format: markdown
    guidance: |
        **Personal data** is any information relating to an 
        identified or identifiable [living individual](#living_individual); an 
        'identifiable' living individual is one who can be 
        identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an 
        identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, 
        an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, 
        physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity 
        of that natural person.

        The term 'indirectly' here indicates that this includes data where 
        identification is made possible by combining one or more sets of data, 
        including synthetic data or trained models.
  - name: pseudonymized_data
    format: markdown
    guidance: |
        **Pseudonymised data** is personal data that has been 
        processed in such a manner that it can no longer be attributed to a 
        specific living individual without the use of additional information, 
        which is kept separately and subject to technical and organisational 
        measures that ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an 
        identified or identifiable living individual.

        Two important things to note are that pseudonymised data:
        
        * is still personal data - it becomes anonymised data, and is no 
        longer personal data, only if *both* the key data connecting 
        pseudonyms to real numbers is securely destroyed, *and* no 
        other data exists in the world which could be used statistically to 
        re-identify individuals from the data
        * depending on the method used, it normally includes synthetic data 
        and models that have been trained on personal data. Expert review is 
        needed to determine the degree to which such datasets could allow 
        individuals to be identified.
        
        It is important that both researchers and Dataset Providers consider 
        the level of confidence they have in the likelihood of identifying 
        individuals from data. Anonymised data is data which under no 
        circumstances can be used to identify an individual, and this is less 
        common than many realise ([Rocher et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038
        /s41467-019-10933-3)).

        Our model specifies three levels of confidence that classifiers can 
        have about the likelihood of reidentification, with each pointing to a 
        different tier - absolute confidence, where no doubt is involved, strong 
        confidence, or weak confidence. Classifiers should give sufficient 
        thought to this question to ensure they are classifying data to the 
        appropriate sensitivity.

    guidance: |
        A **living individual** is an individual for whom you do 
        not have reasonable evidence that they are deceased. If you’re unsure if 
        the data subject is alive or dead, assume they have a lifespan of 100 
        years and act accordingly. If you’re unsure of their age, assume 16 for 
        any adult and 0 for any child, unless you have contextual evidence that 
        allows you to make a reasonable assumption otherwise ([National Archives, 
        2018](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management
        /guide-to-archiving-personal-data.pdf)).
