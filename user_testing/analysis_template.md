# User Testing Analysis
Last updated: June 2022

This document provides details on how to analyse user interviews for the information governance app.

## Introduction

For each step of the user journey, there are key questions we want to answer. We can do this with a Red, Amber, Green (RAG) process, with the scoring:
- **R**: Not at all
- **A**: Somewhat/weak yes
- **G**: Yes
- **Y**: Not applicable/tested

The questions we want to know the answer to are:
* Did the user understand what they were trying to do conceptually?
* Were they able to complete the process themselves?

And more generally:
* Did they agree with the process?
   * This is especially applicable to the questions of the classification process

For example:

```
### Select a project at random from the list of pre-defined dummy projects

1. Click 'View My Projects'
    * **Understand?**: G
    * **Complete?**: G
    * **Comments**:
        * Found the button straight away
        * 'I love how easy it is to see what we need to do'

2. Click the name of the chosen project
    * **Understand?**: G
    * **Complete?**: R
    * **Comments**:
        * 'I didn't realise you could click on the title directly'
        * HS had to step in and explain what to do
        * Wasn't sure which project to choose - need to clarify that any choice is fine

 General thoughts:
   * **Agree with process?**: A
   * **Comments**:
      * 'Makes a lot of intuitive sense, but feel like you should only be able to see one project at a time.'
```

Any actions that need to be taken moving forward should be discussed highlighted below alongside its 'Urgency' (how much of a priority is the action - (Low, Medium, High)) and its 'Difficulty' (how hard is the action to implement - (Low, Medium, High)),. For instance, from the above we might add:

```
* **Action**: Clarify that any project can be chosen by the user in instructions
* **Urgency**: Medium
* **Difficulty** Low
```

Add as many actions as required to represent everything actionable that arose in the interview.
