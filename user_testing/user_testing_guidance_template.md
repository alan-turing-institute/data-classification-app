# Guidance for Turing app UX testing observers - April 2022
< This is a template document - please copy the markdown into a new file to capture the raw data>

Explain to testers that they will be given a short list of tasks and ask them to talk through their thought processes aloud while they work through the list.

Tell them to imagine that they are a researcher starting out on a new project, and that when they enter the app they will see a list of dummy projects and for the purposes of the exercise it doesn't matter which one they pick.

Observer to take notes on each of the tasks, including an estimate of how long it took, whether any aspects seemed to be confusing, and how the tester replied when asked how easy the task was to achieve on a scale of 1 to 10:

1. Select a project at random from the list of pre-defined dummy projects
  * Duration:
  * Confusing:
  * Tester UX score:
  * Comments:

2. Assign a new (dummy) dataset to a project (tester to create metadata, encouraged to make it similar to the real-life data they are currently working on). Assume that the data provider representative associated with the dataset is called Crystal Bowers, and her details have already been added to the app
  * Duration:
  * Confusing:
  * Tester UX score:
  * Comments: 
  
3. Assign random selection of users from pre-defined list of users to other roles in chosen project
  * Duration:
  * Confusing:
  * Tester UX score:
  * Comments:

4. Run through classification of “Ingress” work package
  * Duration:
  * Confusing:
  * UX score:
  * Comments: 

Finally, go back through the questions that appeared while the tester was working through the classification task and assess how relevant each was to their own situation, and whether there was a clear answer in each case. 

Please take notes here:

1. Select a project from the list of pre-defined dummy projects



2. Assign a new (dummy) dataset to a project (tester to create metadata, encouraged to make it similar to the real-life data they are currently working on)


3. Assign users from pre-defined list of users to chosen project



4. Run through classification of “Ingress” work package
