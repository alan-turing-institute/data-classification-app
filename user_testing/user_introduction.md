Welcome to the Data Classification Tool!

This guide provides information on data classification - what it is, how it works and why it's important.

## What is data classification?

It is essential that work with sensitive or confidential datasets is kept secure, to enable analysis of personal data in compliance with data protection law. For this reason, The Alan Turing Institute has established five sensitivity tiers for research with sensitive data, ranging from open data at Tier 0, to highly sensitive and high risk data at Tier 4. As the sensitivity of the data increases, the security controls applied at that tier tighten. 

This Data Classification Tool forms part of this process by:

1. **Providing a place to store information regarding your research project**, such as project aims, individual roles, and details about datasets being used.
2. **Guiding you through a data-sensitivity classification process**, outputting the Tier level most suitable for your research.
3. **Giving instructions on how to handle personal data**, to ensure you are compliant with data protection law.

## How does data classification work?

Classification is based on considering the sensitivity of *all* information handled in the project, not just datasets. 

We define a **work package** as the activities carried out within a distinct phase of work carried out as part of a project, with a specific outcome in mind. A work package can make use of one or more datasets, and includes an idea of the analysis which the research team intends to carry out, the potential outputs they are expecting, and the tools they intend to use - all important factors affecting the data sensitivity.

You can think of a work package as a specific instance of analysis done with one or more datasets. **Classification is carried out on the work packages**, rather than on individual datasets.

## Who is involved with data classification?

In the data classification model, there are four key roles:

* **Investigator**: The research project lead, this individual is responsible for ensuring that project staff comply with the Environment's security policies.
* **Dataset Provider Reprensentative**: A single representative from the organisation who provided the dataset(s) under analysis. They are responsible for liaising with the Investigator, and are authorised to certify sharing of datasets with the researchers.
* **Referee**: A Referee volunteers to review code or derived data (data which is computed from the original dataset(s)), providing evidence to the Investigator and Dataset Provider Representative that the researchers are complying with data-handling practices.
* **Project manager**: A designated staff member at the hosting research institution who is responsibile for running a particular project.

To classify a work package, the Investigator and the Data Provider Representative (and optionally the Referee) will go through a series of questions to help understand the legal sensitivity of the data involved, and the consequences of a data breach. This results in a Tier recommendation, and work can only proceed once these roles agree on the Tier level required.

## What can I do on the app?

The app provides all the functionality required to classify work packages for your project. This includes:

* Creating projects
* Creating and managing work packages
* Assigning datasets to work packages
* Assigning roles to different users
* Assigning users to work packages
* Carrying out classification on work packages

## Key terms

### Data-related

* **Dataset**: The data being used for analysis
* **Egress**: Work package made up of the output of research projects
* **Ingress**: Work package made up of the input for research projects
* **Work Package**: A set of input data together with the data analysis that will be performed on it, and the intended outputs of that analysis

### Role-related

* **Dataset Provider Representative**: A representative of the organisation providing the dataset(s) that are being analysed
* **Investigator**: The overall lead of a research project
* **Project Manager**: The manager of a research project
* **Referee**: A volunteer who reviews the project team's data-handling practices
