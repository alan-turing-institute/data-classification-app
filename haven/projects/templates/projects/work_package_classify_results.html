  <p>You ({{ classification.created_by }}, {{classification.role|project_role_display}}) have classified this work package as Tier {{ classification.tier }}.</p>

  <p>
    {% if classification.tier == 0 %}
      Tier 0 environments are used to handle publicly available, open information, where all generated and combined information is also suitable for open handling.
      Tier 0 applies where none of the information processed, combined or generated includes personal data, commercially sensitive data, or data which will have legal, political or reputational consequences in the event of unauthorised disclosure.
      Tier 0 data should be considered ready for publication.
    {% elif classification.tier == 1 %}
      Tier 1 environments are used to handle, process and generate data that is intended for eventual publication or that could be published without reputational damage to the research institution, data provider or breaching data protection requirements.
      Information is kept private in order to give the research team a competitive advantage, not due to legal data protection requirements.
    {% elif classification.tier == 2 %}
      Tier 2 environments are used to handle, combine or generate information which is not linked to personal data.
      It may be used for pseudonymised or synthetic information generated from personal data, where classifiers have strong confidence in the quality of pseudonymisation.
      Tier 2 environments are also used to handle, combine or generate information which is confidential, but not, in commercial or national security terms, sensitive.
      This includes commercial-in-confidence datasets or intellectual property where the legal, commercial, political and reputational consequences from disclosure are low.
    {% elif classification.tier == 3 %}
      Tier 3 environments are used to handle, combine or generate personal data, other than personal data where there is a risk that disclosure might pose a substantial threat to the personal safety, health or security of the data subjects (which would be Tier 4).
      It includes pseudonymised or synthetic information generated from personal data, where the classifier has only weak confidence in the quality of pseudonymisation.
      Tier 3 environments are also used to handle, combine or generate information, including commercial-in-confidence information and intellectual property, which is sensitive in commercial, legal, political or national security terms.
    {% elif classification.tier == 4 %}
      Tier 4 environments are used to handle, combine or generate personal data where disclosure poses a substantial threat to the personal safety, health or security of the data subjects.
      This also includes handling, combining or generating datasets which are sensitive in commercial or national security terms, and are likely to be subject to attack by sophisticated, well-resourced and determined actors, such as serious organised crime groups and state actors.
      This tier corresponds to the UK government ‘SECRET’ categorisation. It is at Tier 4 that the risk of hostile actors penetrating the project team becomes significant.

{% elif classify_data_href %}
  <p>
    To classify this work package, you will be taken through a series of questions, to help understand the legal sensitivity of the data involved, and the consequences of a data breach.
    Classification should take into consideration all the datasets involved in the work package, their potential combination, an idea of the analysis which the research team intends to carry out, the potential outputs they are expecting, and the tools they intend to use.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is essential that sensitive or confidential datasets are kept secure, to enable analysis of personal data in compliance with data protection law.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the data classification model, there are three key roles: Investigator; Dataset Provider Representative; and Referee (for certain projects).
    Classification is not complete until all relevant people have completed the classification process and come to an agreement on the sensitivity of the work package.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have any queries during the classification process, please contact a Project Manager for assistance.
